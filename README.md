This is a simple implementation of a Http Server in Java. Currently it only serves static files like HTML, Css, Javascript and Images.

The server.jar in the dist folder can be used to execute the server. It serves all files from the public_html folder.

This server was written as a semester project with the restrain on myself to implement it in one day. You ask why? Well... who knows.
