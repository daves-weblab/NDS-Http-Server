This is a simple implementation of a Http Server in Java. Currently it only serves static files like HTML, Css, Javascript and Images.

## Execution ##

The server.jar in the dist folder can be used to execute the server. It serves all files from the public_html.

## Progress ##

This implementation is small project for a course in university so do not expect too much from it, it works but time was a problem (see commits)
